It is a collection of constants, methods(abastact static and default and nested types)

- All the methods of the interface need to be defined in the class
- Interface is like a class

Difference from a class
- can not instantiate an interface and can't contain instance fileds
- An interface has no constructors
- All the methods in an interface are abstract
- all the fields that can appear in an interface must be declared both static and final 
- an intervace can extend multiple interfaces.
