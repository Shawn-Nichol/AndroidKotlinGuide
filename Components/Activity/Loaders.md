# Loaders
Loaders have been depracated as of Android API 28. The recommend option fo r dealing with loading data whil ehandling the activity and Fragment Lifecycles is to use a bombination of ViewModels and LiveData. ViewModles survive configuration changes like Loaders but with less boilerplat. LiveData proivdes a lifecycle-aware wya of loading data that you can reuse in multiple ViewModels. You can also combine LiveData using MediatorLiveData, and any observable queries, such as those from a Room database, can be used to bserve changes tot he data. ViewModels and LiveData are also avaiable in situations wher you do not have access to the LoaderManager, such as in a Service. Using the two in tandem provides an easy way to access the data your app needs without having to deal wi the UI lifecyle.
