Every test has the following steps
- Setup: First have a phase wher you arrange, configure or set up; in this case you instantiate a class
- Assertion: You execute the method that you want to test and you assert the result
- Teardown sometimes there are items in teh setu step that need to be reset after the tests are done running.
