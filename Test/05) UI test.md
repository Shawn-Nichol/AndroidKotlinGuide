# Key Points
- Unit tests verify how isolated parts of your code work. 
- Every test has three phases, set up, assertion and teardown. 
- Using Junit, you can write unit tests asserting results, meaning, you can compare an expected result with the actual one. 
- In TDD, you start by writing a test,. You then write the ocde to make the tes compile. Next you see that the tes fails. Finally, you add the implementation to the methodd under test to make it pass.
