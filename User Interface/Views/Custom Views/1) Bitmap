A bitmap is an object, which is an instance of Bitmap class. This classs represents a 2d coordinate system. The coordinate system move to the right on the x axis, and to the bottom on they axis. Each point in the coordinate system is called a pixel. A pixel is formed of bits, and bits represent the color of the pixel. A pixel can be formed of 8, 16, or 24 bits.


Everything that is drawn in android is a Bitmap. we can create a Bitmap instance, either by using the Bitmap class which has methods that allow us to manipulate pixels in the 2d coordinate system or we can create a bitmap from an image or a file or a resource by using the BitmapFactory class.
