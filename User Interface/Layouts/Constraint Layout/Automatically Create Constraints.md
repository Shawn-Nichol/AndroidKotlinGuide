# Automatically Create constraints
Instead of adding constraints to every view as you place them in the layout, you can move each veiw into the position you desire, and then click `Infer Constraints` to automatically create constraints.

Infer Constraints scans the layout to determine the most effective set of constraints for all views. It makes a best effort to constrain the view to their current positions while allowing flexibility. YOu might need to make some adjustments to be sure the layout responds as you intend for different screen sizes and orientations. 

Autoconnect to parent is a separate feature that you can enbale. If enabled, when you add child views to a parent, this feature autmatically creates tow or mroe constratitns for each view as you add them to the alyout but only whenits appropriate to sontraint the view to the parent layout. 

Autoconnect is disabled by default, Enable it by clicking enbale Autoconnection to Parent int eh Layout Editor toolbar.
