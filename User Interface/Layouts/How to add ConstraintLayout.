# How to add a ConstraintLayout

## Dependencies
1. Ensure you have the maven.google.com repository added in th emodule-level build.gradle.
```
repositories {
    google()
}
```

2. Add the library as a dependency in the same build.gradle file.
```
dependencies {
    implementation "androidx.constraintlayout:constraintlayout:2.0.3"
}
```

## Add and remove constraints
1. Drag a view in a `ConstraintLayout`, it displays a bounding box with square resizing handles on each corner and ciruclar constraint handles on each side. 

2. Click the view to select it. 

3. Drag a constaraint handle to the anchor point.

Constraint Rules
- Every view must have at least two constraints: One Horizontal and one Vertical. 
- You can create constraints only between a constraint hanlde and an anchor point that share the same plane. So Vertical plane of a view can be only be connected to a another vertical plan.
- Each constraint handle can be used for just one constraint, but you can create multiple constrants tothe same anchor point. 

You can delete a constraint by doing any of the following
- Click on a constraint to select it, and the press `Delete`
- Press and hold `Control', and then click on a constraint anchor. Note that the constraint turns ret to indicate that you can click to delete it.
