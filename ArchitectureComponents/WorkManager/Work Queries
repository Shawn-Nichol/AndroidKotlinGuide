# Work Queries
You can find all work by the tag "MyTag", that is in the FAILED or CANCELLED state and has a unique work name of either "pre-Process" or sync"

```
val workQuery = WorkQuery.Builder
  .fromTags(listOf("MyTag"))
  .addStates(ListOf(WorkInfo.State.FAILED, WorkInfo.State.CANCELLED))
  .addUniqueWorkNames(listOf("preProcess", "MyTag"
).build()

val workInfo: ListenableFuture<List<WorkInfo>> = workManager.getWorkInfos(workQuery)
  
```
