# WorkManager
WorkManager is an API that makes it easy to schedule deferrable, asynchronous tasks that are expected to run even if the app exits or the device restarts. The WorkManager API is a suitable and recommended replacement for all previous Android backgroun scheduling APIs(Job Scheduler). Work Manager incorporates the features of its predecessors in a modern, consistent API that works back to API level 14 while also being conscious of batter life. 

## Work Constraints
Declaratively dfine the optimal conditions for your work to run using Work Constraints. For example, run only when the device is on Wi-Fi, when the device idle, or when it has sufficient storage space. 

## Robust Scheduling 
WorkManager allows you to schedule owrk to run one-time or repeatedly using flexible scheduling windows. Work can be tagged and named as well, allowign you to schedule unique, replaceable, work and monitor or cancel groups of work together. Scheduled work is sotred in an interannlly managedSQLite database and WorkManagaer takes care of ensuring that this work persists and is recheduled across device reboots. In addition, WorkManager adheres to power-saving features an best practices like Doze Mode, so you don't have to worry about it. 

## Flexibility Retry Policy
Sometimes work fails. WorkManager offers flexible retry policies, including a configurable exponential backoff policy

## Work Chaining
For complex related work, chain individual work tast toether usinga fluent, natural interface tath allows you to control which pieces run sequentially and which run in parallel. For each work task you can define  input and output data for that work. When chaining work tegether, WorkManager automatically passess output data from one work task to the next. 

```
WorkManager.getInstnac(...) 
  .beginWith(listOf(workA, workB)
  .then(workC)
  .enqueue()
```

## Build-in Threading Interoperability
WorkManager integrates seamlessly with RXJava and Coroutines and provides the flexibility to plug in your own asynchronous APis. 

## Use WorkManager for Deferrable and Reliable Work
WorkManager is inteneded for work that is deferrable- that is not required to run immediately and reuqired to run reliable even if the app exits or the device restarts
- Sendign Logs or analytics to backend services
- Periodicallly syncing application data with a server

WorkManager is not intended for in-process backgroudn work that can safely be terminated if the app process goes away or for twork that requires immediate execution. Please review the background process guide to see which solution meets your needds.
