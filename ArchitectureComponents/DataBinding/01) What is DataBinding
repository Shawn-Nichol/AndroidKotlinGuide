# What is databinding
DataBinding is a support library that allows you to bind UI componetns in your layout to data sources in your app using a declarative format rather than a progammatically. Binding componoents in the layout file lets you remove many UI framework calls in your activites/fragments, making them simpler and easier to maintian. This can alos improve your app's perfromance and help prevent memory leaks and null pointer exceptions. 

The expression language allow syou to write expressions that connect variables to the views in the layout. The DataBinding library automatically generates the classes requiered to bind the views in the layout with your data objects. The library provides features such as imports, variables, and includes that you can use in your layout.
