DataStore is new and imporved data storage solution aimed at replacing SharedPreferences. Build on Kotlin coroutines and Flow, DataStore provides two differen implementations: Proto DataStore, that stores typed objects (backed by protocol buffers) and preferences DataStore, that stores key-valuepairs. Data is stored asynchronously, consistently, and transactionally, overcoming some of the drawbacks of SharedPreferences.
