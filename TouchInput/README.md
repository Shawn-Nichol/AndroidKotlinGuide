# Handle Keyboard input
The Android system shows an on-screen keyboard-known as a soft input method, when a text field in the UI receives focus. To provide the best user experinece, you can specify characteristics about the type of input you expect (such as whether it's a phones number or email address) and how the input method should behave. 

In addition to the on-screen input methods, Android also supports hardware keyborads, so it's important that you app optimize its user experinece for interaction that might occur through an attached keyboard.
