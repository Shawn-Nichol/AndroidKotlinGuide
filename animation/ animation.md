property: , to the animation system, is a field that is exposed via setters and getters, either implicityly (as properties are in Kotlin) or explicityly(viwa the setter/getter pattern in the Java programming language. There are also a special case of properties exposed via the class android.util.propety which is used by the view class, which allows a type-savfe approach for animations. The animator system in Android was specifically written to animnate properties, meaning that can animate anything that has setter. 

ViewProperties: are a set of functionality added to the base View class that allow all views to b transformed in specific ways that are useful in UI animations. There are properties for position rotations, scale and transparency. 

There are actually two different ways to access th propeties by regular setter/getter pairs, like setTranslateX()/getTranslateX(), and tby static android.util.Property objects, like View.Translate_X(an object that has both a get() and a set() method). Android.util.Property have less overhead internally along with better type-safety, but you can also use the setters andgetters of any object. 

Property animation is, simply the changine of property values overt time. ObjectAnimator was created to provide a simple set=andforget mechanism for animating properties. For example, you can define an animator that changes teh alph property of a view, which will alter the transparency of that view on the screen.
