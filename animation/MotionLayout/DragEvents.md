# Drag events
The touchAnchorSide passed to OnSwipe must progress in a single direction through the entire animation. If the anchorded side revereses its path, or pauses, MotionLayout will get confused and not progress in  a smooth motion. In some animation, no view has an approperate touchAnchor side. This may happen if every side follows a complex path through the motion, or views resize in ways that would cause surprising animation. In these situation consider adding a invisble view that follows a simpler path to track

You can also combine dragDirection with touchAnchorSie to make a side track a different direction than it normally would. It's still important that the touchAnchorSide  only progress in one direction, but you can tell MotionLayout which direction to track. For example you ca keep the touchAncorside = "bottom, but add dragDirection="dragRight". This will cause MotionLayout to track the position of the bottom of the view, but only consider its location when moving right. So even through the bottom goes up and down, it will still animate correctly with onSwipe.
