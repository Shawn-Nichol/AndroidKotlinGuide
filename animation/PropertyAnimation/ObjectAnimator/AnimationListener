# Animation Listeners
Listens for imprtant events
Animator.AnimatorListener
  - onAnimatorStart() - called when the animation starts
  - onAnimationRepeat() - called when the animation repeats itself.
  - onAnimationCancel() - called when the animation is canceled.  A canceld animation also called onAnimationEnd.
  - onAnimationEnd() - called when the animation ends. 
  
  ValueAnimator.AnimatorUpdateListeners
  - onAnimationUpdate()( - called on every frame of the animation. Listen to this event to use the calculated values generated by the ValueAnimator during an animation. To use the value, query the valueAnimattor object passed into the evnt to get eh current animated value with the getAnimatedValue(). Implementing the listener is requried if you use ValueAnimator. 
  depeneding on what property or object you are naimating, you might need to call invalidate() on  a View force that are of the screen to reddrarw itself with the new animated values. For example, animating the color property of a drawable object only cuases updates to the screen when that object redraws itself. All of the property setters on View, such as setAlpha() and setTranslationX() invalidate the View properly, so you do not need to invalidate the View ehen calling these methods with new values. 
  
  
You can extedn AnimatorListenerAdapter class instead of implementing the Animator.AnimatorListener interface, if you do not want to implement all of the methods of the Animator.AnimatorListener interface. The animatorListenerAdapter class provides empty implementations of the methods that you cna choose to override. 

```
ObjectAnimator.ofFloat(newBall, "alpha", 1f, 0f).apply {
    duration = 250
    addListener(object : AnimatorListenerAdapter() {
        override fun onAnimationEnd(animation: Animator) {
            balls.remove((animation as ObjectAnimator).target)
        }
    })
}
```
