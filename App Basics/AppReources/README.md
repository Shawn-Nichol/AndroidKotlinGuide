# App Resources. 
Resources are the additional files and static content that your code uses, such as bitmaps, layout definitions, user interface strings, animation instructions, and more. 
You should always externalize app resources such as images and string sfrom your code, so that you can maintain them independently. You should also provide alternative resources for specific device configurations, by grouping them in specially named resources directories. At runtime, Andoid uses the appropriate resource based on the current configuration. For exmample, you might want to provide a different UI layout depending on the screen size or different strings depending on the language. Once you externalize your app resources, you can access them using resource IDs that are generated in your projects's R class. T
