# Tile Mode
The tiling mode, TileMode, defined in the Shader, specifies how the bitmap drawable is repeated or mirrored in teh X and Y directions if the bitmap drawable being used for texture is smaller than the screen. Android provides three different ways to repeat(tile the bitmap drawable. 

- Repeat: Repeats the bitmap shader's image horizontally and vertically. 
- CLAMP: The edge colors will be used to fill the extra space outside of the shader's image bounds 
- Mirror: the shader's image is mirroed horizontally and vertically.
